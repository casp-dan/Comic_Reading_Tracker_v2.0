The second version of my comic reading tracking app. This version is uses electron.js with HTML and CSS, with a Python backend using Flask and mySQL. The structure for the database is included in the SQL folder. 

This app can:
- track all singular comic issues being read
- present all issues of any series in the database as well as the date each issue has been read
- present every issue read on a given date indicating the series name and issue number
- provide stats on reading habits by publisher. Can filter for individual months, years, or between any two given dates.

Launches as an electron app.
